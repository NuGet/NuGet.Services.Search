# NuGet.Services.Search

This repo contains NuGet's V2 [Lucene.Net](https://lucenenet.apache.org)-powered Search Service and uses Azure Storage as a backing store. It has been replaced by NuGet's V3 search available at [NuGet/NuGet.Services.Metadata](https://github.com/nuget/nuget.services.metadata).
